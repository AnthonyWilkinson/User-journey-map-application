# User journey mapping tool

This is a user journey mapping application which can be used to create personas and user journey maps and keep them all in one place. The application allows users to register their own account which then they can work on different projects together with other employees at the same time.

This reposoitry is a copy of the original one located on my university github private account. This copy can be used to make any changes to the design and improve the build process of the application.
